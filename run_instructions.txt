Necessary Libraries:
	csv, random

Main File:
	project_1_final.py

Secondary File:
	node.py

Run Instructions:

Run project_1_final.py in command line in order to be able to input start states and goal states
	If you do not want to run with user input then change the user_input flag to be False in App() at the bottom of project_1_final.py

Output Files:
	nodes.txt 
		- output of all nodes that have been created while solving the puzzle
		- format is column first and space separated
		- eg: puzzle state = 123
							 456
							 780
			  output format: 1 4 7 2 5 6 3 6 0
		- line number in text file corresponds to node index

	node_path.txt
		- output of all nodes in the path between the starting state and the goal state assuming that a solution is possible
		- if no solution is possible then this file will be empty
		- format is: column first and space separated
		- eg: puzzle state = 123
							 456
							 780
			  output format: 1 4 7 2 5 6 3 6 0
		- line number in text file corresponds to node index

	nodes_info.txt
		- output of the info for each node that has been visited while solving the puzzle
		- format is: node index, parent node index, cost to reach node and space separated
		- Note: cost to reach node may be incorrect at the moment but is not the same for each node
		- eg: node index = 45, parent node index = 12, cost to reach nodes = 4
			  output format: 45 12 4
		- line number in text file corresponds to node index
